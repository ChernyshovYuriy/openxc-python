Firmware Configuration Examples
===============================

If you haven't created a custom firmware for the OpenXC VI yet, we recommend the
`getting started with custom data guide
<http://openxcplatform.com/firmware/custom-data-example.html>`_.

For all examples, the ``name`` field for message is optional but strongly
encouraged to help keep track of the mapping.

When an example refers to "sending" a translated or raw message, it means
sending to the app developer via one of the output interfaces (e.g. USB,
Bluetooth) and not sending to the CAN bus. For examples of configuring writable
messages and signals that *do* write back to the CAN bus, see the :doc:`write
configuration examples <config-write-examples>`.

.. _onebus-onesignal:

One Bus, One Numeric Signal
==============================

We want to read a single, numeric signal from a high speed bus on controller 1.
The signal is 7 bits wide, starting from bit 5 in message ID ``0x102``. We want
the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``my_openxc_measurement``.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

.. _basic-transformed:

Transformed Numeric Signal
==========================

We want to read the same signal as in the :ref:`One Bus, One Numeric Signal
<onebus-onesignal>` example, but we want to transform the value with a factor
and offset before sending it to eh app developer. The value on CAN must be
multiplied by -1.0 and offset by 1400.


.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "factor": -1.0,
                       "offset": 1400
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We added the ``factor`` and ``offset`` attributes to the signal.

One Bus, One Boolean Signal
===========================

We want to read a boolean signal from a high speed bus on controller 1.
The signal is 1 bits wide, starting from bit 32 in message ID ``0x103``. We want
the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``my_boolean_measurement``. Because it is a boolean type, the value will appear
as ``true`` or ``false`` in the JSON for app developers.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x103": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Boolean_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_boolean_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 32,
                       "bit_size": 1,
                       "handler": "booleanHandler"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We set the ``handler`` for the signal to the ``booleanHandler``, one of the
:ref:`built-in signal handler functions <value-handlers>` - this will transform
the numeric value from the bus (a ``0`` or ``1``) into first-class boolean
values (``true`` or ``false``).

.. _state-based:

One Bus, One State-based Signal
===============================

We want to read a signal from a high speed bus on controller 1 that has numeric
values corresponding to a set of states - what we call a state-based signal

The signal is 3 bits wide, starting from bit 28 in message ID ``0x104``. We want
the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``active_state``. There are 6 valid states from 0-5, and we want those to
appears as the state strings ``a`` through ``f`` in the JSON for app developers.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x104": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_State_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "active_state",
                       "bit_position": 28,
                       "bit_size": 3,
                       "states": {
                           "a": [0],
                           "b": [1],
                           "c": [2],
                           "d": [3],
                           "e": [4],
                           "f": [5]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We set the ``states`` field for the signal to a JSON object mapping the string
value for each state to the numerical values to which it corresponds. This
automatically will set the ``handler`` to the ``stateHandler``, one of the
:ref:`built-in signal handler functions <value-handlers>`.

Combined State-based Signal
===========================

We want to read the same state-based signal from :ref:`state-based` but we want
the values 0-3 on the bus to all correspond with state ``a`` and values ``4-5``
to the string state ``b``.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x104": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_State_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "active_state",
                       "bit_position": 28,
                       "bit_size": 3,
                       "states": {
                           "a": [0, 1, 2, 3],
                           "b": [4, 5]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

Each state string maps to an array - this can seem unnecessary when you only
have 1 numeric value for each state, but it allows combined mappings as in this
example.

Two Buses, Two Signals
======================

We want to read two numeric signals - one from a message on a high speed bus on
controller 1, and the other from a message on a medium speed bus on controller
2.

The signal on the high speed bus is 12 bits wide, starting from bit 11 in
message ID ``0x108``. We want the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers
to be ``my_first_measurement``.

The signal on the medium speed bus 14 bits wide, starting from bit 0 in message
ID ``0x90``. We want the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``my_second_measurement``.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           },
           "ms": {
               "controller": 2,
               "speed": 125000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x108": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_first_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 11,
                       "bit_size": 12
                   }
               }
           }
           "0x90": {
               "bus": "ms",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Other_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_second_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 0,
                       "bit_size": 14
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We added the second bus to the ``buses`` field and assigned it to controller 2.
We added the second message object and made sure to set its ``bus`` field to
``ms``.

.. _limited-translated:

Limited Translated Signal Rate
==============================

We want to read the same signal as in the :ref:`One Bus, One Numeric Signal
<onebus-onesignal>` example, but we want it to be sent at a maximum of 5Hz. We
want the firmware to pick out messages at a regular period, but we don't care
which data is dropped in order to stay under the maximum.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "max_frequency": 5
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We set the ``max_frequency`` field of the signal to 5 (meaning 5Hz) - the
firmware will automatically handle skipping messages to stay below this limit.

.. _limited-translated-unchanged:

Limited Translated Signal Rate if Unchanged
===========================================

We want the same signal from :ref:`limited-translated` at a limited rate, but we
don't want to lose any information - if the value of the signal changes, we want
it to be sent regardless of the max frequency. Repeated, duplicate signal values
are fairly common in vehicles, where a signal is sent at a steady frequency
even if the value hasn't changed. For this example, we want to preserve all
information - if a signal changes, we want to make sure the data is sent.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "max_frequency": 5,
                       "force_send_changed": true
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We added the ``force_send_changed`` field to the signal, which will make sure
the signal is sent immediately when the value changes. This rate limiting is
lossless.

Send Signal on Change Only
===========================

We want to limit the rate of a signal as in :ref:`limited-translated-unchanged`,
but we want to be more strict - the signal should only be translated and sent to
app developers if it actually changes.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "send_same": false
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We accomplish this by setting the ``send_same`` field to false. This is most
appropriate for boolean and state-based signals where the transition is most
important. Considering that a host device may connect to the VI *after* the
message has been sent, using this field has the potential of making it difficult
to tell the current state of the vehicle on startup - you have to wait for a
state change before knowing any values. For that reason, we've moved away from
using this for most firmware (using a combination of a ``max_frequency`` of 1Hz
and ``force_send_changed == true``) but the option is still available.

.. _custom-transformed:

Custom Transformed Numeric Signal
=================================

Similar to the :ref:`basic-transformed` example, we want to modify a numeric
value read from a CAN signal before sending it to the app developer, but the
the desired transformation isn't as simple as an offset. We want to read the
same signal as before, but if it's below 100 it should be rounded down to 0. We
want our custom transformation to happen *after* using the existing factor and
offset.

To accomplish this, we need to know a little C - we will write a custom signal
handler to make the transformation. Here's the JSON configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "factor": -1.0,
                       "offset": 1400,
                       "handler": "ourRoundingHandler"
                   }
               }
           }
       },
       "extra_sources": [
         "my_handlers.cpp"
       ]
   }

We set the ``handler`` for the signal to ``ourRoundingHandler``, and we'll
define that in a separate file named ``my_handlers.cpp``. The ``extra_sources``
field is also set, meaning that our custom C/C++ code will be included with the
firmware build.

In ``my_handlers.cpp``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   /* Round the value down to 0 if it's less than 100. */
   float ourRoundingHandler(CanSignal* signal, CanSignal* signals,
         int signalCount, float value, bool* send) {
      if(value < 100) {
         value = 0;
      }
      return value;
   }

After being transformed with the factor and offset for the signal from the
configuration file, the value is passed to our handler function. We make
whatever custom transformation required and return the new value.

There are a few other valid type signatures for these :ref:`custom value
handlers <value-handlers>` - for converting numeric values to boolean or
state-based signals.

Transformed with Signal Reference
==================================

We need to combine the values of two signals from a CAN message to create a
single value - one signal is the absolute value, the other is the sign.

Both signals are on the high speed bus in the message with ID ``0x110``. The
absolute value signal is 5 bits wide, starting from bit 2. The sign signal is 1
bit wide, starting from bit 12 - when the value of the sign signal is 0, the
final value should be negative. We want to the final value to be sent to app
developers with the name ``my_signed_measurement``.

We will use a custom value handler for the signal to reference the sign
signal's last value when transforming the absolute value signal.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x110": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Value_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_signed_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 2,
                       "bit_size": 5,
                       "handler": "ourSigningHandler"
                   },
                   "My_Sign_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "sign_of_signal",
                       "bit_position": 12,
                       "bit_size": 1,
                       "handler": "ignoreHandler"
                   }
               }
           }
       },
       "extra_sources": [
         "my_handlers.cpp"
       ]
   }

We don't want to the sign signal to be sent separately on the output interfaces,
but we need the firmware to read and store its value so we can refer to it from
our custom handler. We set the sign signal's ``handler`` to ``ignoreHandler``
which will still process and store the value, but withold it from the output
data stream.

For the absolute value signal, we set the ``handler`` to a custom function where
we look up the sign signal and use its value to transform the absolute value. In
``my_handlers.cpp``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   /* Load the last value for the sign signal and multiply the absolute value
   by it. */
   float ourRoundingHandler(CanSignal* signal, CanSignal* signals,
         int signalCount, float value, bool* send) {
       CanSignal* signSignal = lookupSignal("sign_of_signal",
               signals, signalCount);

       if(signSignal == NULL) {
           debug("Unable to find sign signal");
           *send = false;
       } else {
           if(signSignal->lastValue == 0) {
               // left turn
               value *= -1;
           }
       }
       return value;
   }

We use the `lookupSignal`` function to load a struct representing the
``sign_of_signal`` CAN signal we defined in the configuration, and check the
``lastValue`` attribute of the struct. If for some reason we aren't able to find
the configured sign signal, ``lookupSignal`` will return NULL and we can stop
hold the output of the final value by flipping ``*send`` to false. The firmware
will check the value of ``*send`` after each call to a custom handler to confirm
if the translation pipeline should continue.

One slight problem with this approach: there is currently no guaranteed
ordering for the signals. It's possible the ``lastValue`` for the sign signal
isn't from the same message as the absolute value signal you are current
handling in the function. With a continuous value, there's only a small window
where this could happen, but if you must be sure the values came from the same
message, you may need to write a :ref:`custom-message-handler`.

.. _custom-message-handler:

Composite Signal
================

We want complete control over the output of a measurement from the car. We have
a CAN message that includes 3 different signals that represent a GPS latitude
value, and want to combine them into a single value in degrees.

The three signals are in the message ``0x87`` on a high speed bus connected to
controller 1. The three signals:

- The whole latitude degrees signal starts at bit 10 and is 8 bits wide. The
  value on CAN requires an offset of -89.0.
- The latitude minutes signal starts at bit 18 and is 6 bits wide.
- The latitude minute fraction signal starts at bit 24 and is 14 bits wide. The
  value on CAN requires a factor of .0001.

We made two changes to the configuration from a simple translation config:

- We set the ``ignore`` field to ``true`` for each of the component signals
  in the message. The signal definitions (i.e. the position, offset, etc) will
  be included in the firmware build so we can access it from a custom message
  handler, but the signals will not be processed by the normal translation
  stack.
- We set the ``handler`` for the ``0x87`` message (notice that unlike in other
  examples the ``handler`` is set on the message object in the config, not any
  of the signals) to our custom message handler, ``latitudeMessageHandler``.

In ``my_handlers.cpp``:

.. code-block:: cpp

    /* Combine latitude signals split into their components (degrees,
     * minutes and fractional minutes) into 1 output message: latitude in
     * degrees with with decimal precision.
     *
     * The following signals must be defined in the signal array, and they must
     * all be contained in the same CAN message:
     *
     *      * latitude_degrees
     *      * latitude_minutes
     *      * latitude_minutes_fraction
     *
     * This is a message handler, and takes care of sending the output message.
     *
     * messageId - The ID of the received GPS latitude CAN message.
     * data - The CAN message data containing all GPS latitude information.
     * signals - The list of all signals.
     * signalCount - The length of the signals array.
     * send - (output) Flip this to false if the message should not be sent.
     * pipeline - The pipeline that wraps the output devices.
     *
     * This type signature is required for all custom message handlers.
     */
    void latitudeMessageHandler(int messageId, uint64_t data,
            CanSignal* signals, int signalCount, Pipeline* pipeline) {
        // Retrieve the CanSignal struct representations of the 3 latitude
        // component signals. These are still included in the firmware build
        // when the 'ignore' flag was true for the signals.
        CanSignal* latitudeDegreesSignal =
            lookupSignal("latitude_degrees", signals, signalCount);
        CanSignal* latitudeMinutesSignal =

        // Decode and transform (using any factor and offset defined in the

        float latitudeMinutes = preTranslate(latitudeMinutesSignal, data, &send);
        float latitudeMinuteFraction = preTranslate(
                latitudeMinuteFractionSignal, data, &send);

        // if we were able to decode all 3 component signals (i.e. none of the
        // calls to preTranslate flipped 'send' to false
        if(send) {
            float latitude = (latitudeMinutes + latitudeMinuteFraction) / 60.0;
            if(latitudeDegrees < 0) {
                latitude *= -1;
            }
            latitude += latitudeDegrees;

            // Send the final latitude value to the output interfaces (via the
            // pipeline)
            sendNumericalMessage("latitude", latitude, pipeline);
        }

        // Conclude by updating the metadata for each of the component signals
        // with postTranslate
        postTranslate(latitudeDegreesSignal, latitudeDegrees);
        postTranslate(latitudeMinutesSignal, latitudeMinutes);
        postTranslate(latitudeMinuteFractionSignal, latitudeMinuteFraction);
    }

A more complete, functional example of a message handler is included in the VI
firmware repository - one that handles `both latitude and longitude in a CAN
message
<https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware/blob/master/src/shared_handlers.h#L204>`_.
There is also additional documentation on the :ref:`message handler type
signature <message-handlers>`.

.. _unfiltered-raw:

Unfiltered Raw CAN
==================

We want to read all raw CAN messages from a bus at full speed. Be aware that the
VI hasn't been optimized for this level of throughput, and it's not guaranteed
at this time that messages will not be dropped. We recommend using rate
limiting, which can dramatically decrease the bandwidth required without losing
any information.

.. code-block:: js

  {   "buses": {
          "hs": {
              "controller": 1,
              "speed": 500000,
              "raw_can_mode": "unfiltered"
          }
      }
  }

Filtered Raw CAN
=================

We want to read only the message with ID ``0x21`` from a high speed bus on
controller 1.

.. code-block:: js

  {   "buses": {
          "hs": {
              "controller": 1,
              "speed": 500000,
              "raw_can_mode": "filtered"
          }
      },
      "messages": {
        "0x21": {
          "bus": "hs"
        }
      }
  }

We added the ``0x21`` message and assigned it to bus ``hs``, but didn't define
any signals (it's not necessary when using the raw CAN mode).

.. _unfiltered-limited:

Unfiltered Raw CAN with Limited, Variable Data Rate
===================================================

We want to read all raw CAN messages from a bus, but we don't want the output
interface to be overwhelmed by repeated duplicate messages. This is fairly
common in vehicles, where a message is sent at a steady frequency even if the
value hasn't changed. For this example, we want to preserve all information - if
a message changes, we want to make sure the data is sent.

.. code-block:: js

  {   "buses": {
          "hs": {
              "controller": 1,
              "speed": 500000,
              "raw_can_mode": "unfiltered",
              "max_message_frequency": 1,
              "force_send_changed": true
          }
      }
  }

We combine two attributes to both limit the data rate from raw CAN messages, and
also make sure the transfer is lossless. The ``max_message_frequency`` field
sets the maximum send frequency for CAN messages that have not changed to 1Hz.
We also set the ``force_send_changed`` field to ``true``, which will cause a CAN
message with a new value to be sent to the output interface immediately, even if
it would go above the 1Hz frequency. The result is that each CAN message is sent
at a minimum of 1Hz and a maximum of the true rate of change for the message.

Unfiltered Raw CAN with Strict, Limited Data Rate
=================================================

We want to read all raw CAN messages as in :ref:`unfiltered-limited` but we want
to set a strict limit on the read frequency of each CAN message. We don't care
if we skip some CAN messages, even if they have new data - the maximum frequency
is the most important thing.

.. code-block:: js

  {   "buses": {
          "hs": {
              "controller": 1,
              "speed": 500000,
              "raw_can_mode": "unfiltered",
              "max_message_frequency": 1
          }
      }
  }

We left the ``force_send_changed`` field out - by default it is set to ``false``
and the firmware will strictly enforce the max message frequency.

Translated and Raw CAN Together
================================

We want to read the same signal as in the :ref:`One Bus, One Numeric Signal
<onebus-onesignal>` example, but we also want to receive all unfiltered raw CAN
messages simultaneously.

.. code-block:: sh

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "raw_can_mode": "unfiltered",
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We added set the ``raw_can_mode`` for the bus to ``unfiltered``, as in
:ref:`unfiltered-raw`. No other changes are required - the raw and translated
message co-exist peacefully. If we set ``raw_can_mode`` to ``filtered``, it
would only send the raw message for ``0x102``, where we're getting the numeric
signal.
